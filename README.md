# Age_Noise
This project was in collaboration with our undergraduate summer intern, Lily and our post-doc Shae.
The data we collected were data from young and older adults when they were categorizing sounds beer/pier in noisy conditions. The speech sounds were manipulated
along two acoustic dimensions ranging from beer to pier and the participants were instructed to simply indicate whether the sound was beer or pier.
The script shown here is a template analysis script for Lily to learn how to analyze the data, including how participants 'weight' each acoustic dimension,
how the young listeners differed from older listeners etc.
